# Migrate and Modernise SQL Servers to Azure
### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview
Migrating and modernizing SQL Servers to Azure involves moving on-premises databases to cloud-based solutions like Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or SQL Server on Azure VMs. This process includes assessing existing workloads, choosing the appropriate migration approach, and leveraging Azure's cloud-native features for enhanced performance, security, and scalability. Post-migration, organizations benefit from automated backups, high availability, cost optimization, and continuous monitoring, all while reducing operational overhead and improving business continuity.

## Objective
- **Create and Setup Azure Migrate Project and Appliance**
- **Discover and Assess On-premises Workloads to set up your environment on Azure to Migrate Servers**
- **Migrate the on-premises database to Azure SQL Database**
- **Perform database assessments**
- **Migrate the database to SQL MI**
- **Update the web application to use the new SQL MI database**
