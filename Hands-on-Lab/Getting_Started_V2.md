# Migrate and Modernise SQL Servers to Azure
### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview
Migrating and modernizing SQL Servers to Azure involves moving on-premises databases to cloud-based solutions like Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or SQL Server on Azure VMs. This process includes assessing existing workloads, choosing the appropriate migration approach, and leveraging Azure's cloud-native features for enhanced performance, security, and scalability. Post-migration, organizations benefit from automated backups, high availability, cost optimization, and continuous monitoring, all while reducing operational overhead and improving business continuity.

## Objective
Migrate on-premises SQL Server databases and applications to Azure by creating an Azure Migrate project, assessing workloads, and executing database migrations to both Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, while updating the web application for seamless integration.

- **Migrate Windows and Linux Servers to Azure:** In this lab, you will learn how to use Azure Migrate service to assess the on-premises environment and migrate the servers to Azure. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization, right-sizing of on-premises resources and finally migrating the servers to Azure with Azure Migrate resource which provide provides a simplified migration, modernization, and optimization service for Azure.
- **Migrate the on-premises database to Azure SQL Database:** In this lab, you will use an Azure Migrate: Database Assessment tool called Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the PartsUnlimited database for migration to the Azure SQL Database. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and Azure SQL Database. After the assessment, you will use an Azure Migrate: Database Migration service called Azure Database Migration Service (DMS). During the exercise, you will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted on virtual machines running on Azure.
- **Migrate SQL to Azure SQL Managed Instance:** In this lab, you will connect to the WideWorldImporters database on the SqlServer2008 VM and perform assessments for migration to Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. These assessments will help you understand the compatibility and readiness of your database for migration to Azure. You will evaluate the database schema, data, and performance to identify any potential issues and determine the best migration strategy. This process ensures a smooth transition to Azure’s cloud services, leveraging their scalability, security, and advanced features.
## Prerequisites

Participants should have a basic understanding of the following:

- **Azure Migrate:** Familiarity with Azure Migrate for assessing and migrating on-premises workloads.
- **Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance:** Basic knowledge of Azure SQL services and their features.
- **Azure Portal Navigation:** Experience navigating the Azure portal for managing resources.
- **SQL Server Management:** Understanding of SQL Server concepts and operations.
- **Networking Basics:** Familiarity with creating SMB shares and managing network configurations.
- **Web Application Deployment:** Basic knowledge of deploying Web Applications to Azure and configuring App Service settings.

## Architecture
In this migration architecture, SQL Server 2008 databases are assessed for compatibility with **Azure SQL Database** using the **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)**. Dependency visualization ensures smooth migration by mapping application components. The schema is then migrated from **SQLServer2008 VM** to **Azure SQL Database** using DMA. Advanced migration tasks include backups, creating SMB shares, and running an online data migration to **Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI)**. After verifying transaction logs and completing the cutover, **Azure App Service** configurations are updated to connect to the new database endpoints.

## Explanation of Components
The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure Migrate:** A service that helps assess and migrate on-premises workloads to Azure, providing tools for discovery, assessment, and migration.
- **Azure SQL Database:** A fully managed database service that provides scalability, security, and high availability for SQL workloads in the cloud.
- **Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI):** Offers near 100% compatibility with the SQL Server engine and is designed for easy migration of existing SQL Server workloads to Azure.
- **Azure App Service:** A fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.
- **SMB Network Share:** A file-sharing protocol used to create shared folders for backups or data transfer in the migration process.
