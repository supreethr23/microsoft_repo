# Lab 1: Migrating Windows & SQL Server workloads

### Estimated time: 60 minutes

In this HOL, you will use Azure Migrate: Server Assessment to assess the on-premises environment. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

## Lab objectives

In this HOL, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment
- Exercise 2: Set up your environment on Azure to migrate servers
- Exercise 3: Migrating your apps and your data, leveraging Microsoft services and tools including Azure Migrate: Server Migration
- Exercise 4: Optimizing newly migrated workloads, and emphasizing commonalities across all stacks

### Exercise 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

In this exercise, you will deploy the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs and returns that data to your Azure Migrate project.

1. If you are not logged in already, click on the Azure portal shortcut that is available on the desktop and log in with below Azure credentials.
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

2. Click on **Show Portal Menu (1)** bar and select **All services (2)** in the portal's left navigation.
