# HOL 1: Migrate Windows and Linux Servers to Azure

Duration: 25 minutes

## Exercise 2: Discover and Assess On-premises Workloads to set up your environment on Azure to Migrate Servers

### Task 1: Create a migration assessment

In this task, you will use Azure Migrate to create a migration assessment for the SmartHotel application, using the data gathered during the discovery phase.

1. Select **Assess (1)** under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment** and click on **Azure VM (2)** to start a new migration assessment.

4. Select **Next** to move to the **Select servers to assess** tab and enter the following information:
     
     1. Assessment name: Enter **MigrateServersAssessment (1)** 
     1. Select or create a group: Choose **Create New (2)**  
     1. Enter the Group name: **Hyper-V VMs (3)**
     1. Add machines to the Group:  Select **MigrateAppl(Hyper-V) (4)** from dropdown.
     1. Select the **WindowsServer**, **UbuntuServer**, and **redhat** VMs **(5)** and
     1. Click on **Next: Review+Create assessment (6)**.

    > **Note**: There is no need to include the **AzureArcVM**, **AzureMigrateAppliance** and other VMs in the assessment, since they will not be migrated to Azure.
    
    > **Note**: Please note that even though we are adding **redhat** VM to the assessment here, we will not be setting up our environment in redhat VM in this exercise. It is just for users to review the assessment.
    
    
5. Click on **Create assessment** to create the assessment.

6. In Azure Migrate, on the **Servers, databases, and web apps** blade, select **Refresh** periodically until the number of assessments shown is **1** (This may take few minutes). Once the assessments count is updated, click on **1** that is next to **Total** under **Assessments**.  

    ![Screenshot from Azure Migrate showing the number of assessments as '1'.](Images/hol1-exe2-step6-select-total-assessment.png "Azure Migrate - Assessments (count)")
    
7. Select **Assessments (1)** under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment** to see a list of assessments. Then select the **actual assessment (2)**.

    ![Screenshot showing a list of Azure Migrate assessments. There is only one assessment in the list. It has been highlighted.](Images/hol1-exe2-step7-select-assessment-group.png "Azure Migrate - Assessments (list)")

### Task 2: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application does not run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, select **Servers, databases and web apps (1)**. Under **Discovery and assessment**, select **1 (2)** under **Groups**.

    ![](Images/hol1-exe2-task2-step1-select-groups.png)   

2. Under the **Groups (1)** pane, select the **Hyper-V VMs (2)** group to see the group details. 

    ![](Images/hol1-exe2-task2-step2-select-hyperv-group.png)   

3. Note that each VM has their **Dependencies** status as **Requires agent installation**. Select **Requires agent installation** for the **WindowsServer** VM.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel VMs group. Each VM has dependency status 'Requires agent installation'.](Images/hol1-exe2-task2-step3-view-require-agent-dependency.png "Hyper-V VMs server group")

4. On the **Dependencies** blade, select **Configure Log Analytics workspace**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade, with the 'Configure OMS Workspace' button highlighted.](Images/hol1-exe2-task2-step4-select-configure-log-analytics-ws.png "Configure OMS Workspace link")

5. On the **Configure Log Analytics workspace** blade, provide the below information and select **Configure (4)**.

   - Log Analytics workspace: Click on **Create new (1)** and enter **AzureMigrateWS<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)**
   - Log Analytics workspace location: Select **East US (3)** from the dropdown.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Configure OMS workspace' blade.](Images/upd-createLAW.png "OMS Workspace settings")

    ![Screenshot for installing Dependency Agent.](Images/dependencyagent2.png "Dependency Agent installation") 
 

    > **Note**: You do not need to configure the workspace ID and key when installing the Dependency Agent, since it uses the same settings as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, which must be installed beforehand.

24. Close the virtual machine connection window for the **WindowsServer VM**.

25. Open a command prompt using the desktop shortcut.  

    > **Note**: The HostVM runs Windows Server 2019 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled. This allows the command prompt to be used as an SSH client. More info of supported Linux on Azure can be found here: https://Azure.com/Linux. 

26. Enter the following command to connect to the **UbuntuServer** VM running in Hyper-V on the HostVM:

    ```bash
    ssh demouser@192.168.0.8
    ```

27. Enter 'yes' when prompted whether to connect. Use the password **<inject key="On-prem Servers Admin Password" />**.

    ![Screenshot showing the command prompt with an SSH session to UbuntuWAF.](Images/ssh.png "SSH session with UbuntuWAF")

28. Enter the following command, followed by the password **<inject key="On-prem Servers Admin Password" />** when prompted:
  
    ```
    sudo -s
    ```

    > This gives the terminal session elevated privileges.

29. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> and \<Primary Key\> with the values copied previously. Answer **Yes** by using keyboard arrows and Enter key when prompted to restart services during package upgrades without asking.  

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <Workspace ID> -s <Primary Key>
    ```
    
    > **Note**:
    >> a) If you receive any error while running the above command, run the below command to update the packages and perform **Step 28** again.
    
    >> b) If you receive a warning **The Log Analytics agent is on a deprecation path**, then ignore it. 


     ```
     apt-get update
     ```

29. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> with the value copied earlier:

    ```s
    /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart <Workspace ID>
    ```

30. Enter the following command. This downloads a script that will install the Dependency Agent.

    ```s
    wget --content-disposition https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux -O InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
    ```

31. Install the dependency agent by running the script download in the previous step.

    ```s
    sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -s
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing that the Dependency Agent install on Linux was successful.](Images/da-linux-done.png "Dependency Agent installation was successful")
    

32. Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate **Hyper-V VMs** VM group blade. The 2 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as **Installed**. (If not, refresh the page **using the browser refresh button**, not the refresh button in the blade.  It may take up to **5 minutes** after installation for the status to be updated.)

    ![Screenshot showing the dependency agent installed on each VM in the Azure Migrate VM group.](Images/hol1-exe2-task2-step32-dependency-agent-status.png "Dependency agent installed")
   
     >**Note**: If you notice that the dependency agent status is showing as **Requires Agent Installation** instead of Installed even after installing dependency agents in all the three VMs, please follow the steps from [here](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Migrate-and-Secure-Workloads/blob/main/labguide/HelpDoc-AzureMigrate.md) to confirm dependency agent installation in VMs using Log Analytics workspace.
 
33. Select **View dependencies**.

    ![Screenshot showing the view dependencies button in the Azure Migrate VM group blade.](Images/hol1-exe2-task2-step33-select-view-dependency-button.png "View dependencies")
   
34. Take a few minutes to explore the dependencies view. Expand each server to show the processes running on that server. Select a process to see process information. See which connections each server makes.
