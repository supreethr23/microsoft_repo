# Hands-On-Lab 3: Migrate SQL to Azure SQL Managed Instance
### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

In this lab, you will connect to the WideWorldImporters database on the SqlServer2008 VM and perform assessments for migration to Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. These assessments will help you understand the compatibility and readiness of your database for migration to Azure. You will evaluate the database schema, data, and performance to identify any potential issues and determine the best migration strategy. This process ensures a smooth transition to Azureâ€™s cloud services, leveraging their scalability, security, and advanced features.


## Lab Objective

In this Exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Connect to the WideWorldImporters database on the SqlServer2008 VM

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    -- Update the recovery model of the database to FULL and enable Service Broker
    ALTER DATABASE WideWorldImporters SET
    RECOVERY FULL,
    ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK IMimagesTE;
    GO
    ```

1. To run the script, select **Run** from the Azure Data Studio toolbar.

    ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](images/Ex1-Task1-S14.png "SSMS Toolbar")

## Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

In this task, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the `WideWorldImporters` database against the Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

1. In Azure Data Studio click on **Azure SQL migration** and click on **+ New migration**.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](images/Ex1-Task2-S1.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In **Step 1: Database for assessment**, select **widewordimplantation**, click on **Next**. 

   ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](images/Ex1-Task2-S2.png "New DMA project")

3. In **Step 2: Assessment summary and SKU recommendation (1)**, you will view the summary and SKU recommendations for your SQL server. Click on **Next (2)**. 

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](images/E1T2S31.png "New project settings")

4. In **Step 3: Target Platform and Assessment Results**, Select **Azure SQL DataBase(1)** from the drop down. Then select **WideWorldImporters(2)** under the database, review the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL DB, and Click on the **Cancel (3)** button.

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](images/E1T2S41.png "New project settings")

    > The DMA assessment for migrating the `WideWorldImporters` database to a target platform of Azure SQL DB reveals features in use that are not supported. These features, including Service broker, prevent WWI from migrating to the Azure SQL DB PaaS offering without making changes to their database.

## Task 3: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Managed Instance

With one PaaS offering ruled out due to feature parity, perform a second DMA assessment against Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the SQL MI service.

1. In Azure Data Studio click on **Azure SQL migration** and click on **+ New migration**.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](images/Ex1-Task2-S1.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In **Step 1: Database for assessment**, select **widewordimplantation**, click on **Next**. 

   ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](images/Ex1-Task2-S2.png "New DMA project")

3. In **Step 2: Assessment summary and SKU recommendation (1)**, you will view the summary and SKU recommendations for your SQL server. Click on **Next (2)**. 

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](images/E1T2S3.png "New project settings")

4.  In **Step 3: Target Platform and Assessment Results**, Select **Azure SQL Managed Instance (1)** from the drop down. Then select **WideWorldImporters (2)** under the database, review the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL DB, and Click on the **Cancel (3)** button.

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](images/E1T3S41.png "New project settings")

10. The database, including the Service Broker feature, can be migrated as is, providing an opportunity for WWI to have a fully managed PaaS database running in Azure. Previously, their only option for migrating a database using features incompatible with Azure SQL Database, such as Service Broker, was to deploy the database to a virtual machine running in Azure (IaaS) or modify the database and associated applications to remove the use of the unsupported features. The introduction of Azure SQL MI, however, provides the ability to migrate databases into a managed Azure SQL database service with _near 100% compatibility_, including the features that prevented them from using Azure SQL Database.

## Summary
In this exercise we focuses on connecting to the WideWorldImporters database on the SqlServer2008 VM and assessing its readiness for migration to Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance using the Data Migration Assistant to ensure compatibility and smooth transition.
