# Hands-On-Lab 3: Migrate SQL to Azure SQL Managed Instance
### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes
In this lab, you will migrate the WideWorldImporters database from a SQL Server 2008 VM to Azure SQL Managed Instance. You’ll start by setting up an SMB network share and configuring the MSSQLSERVER service to run under the sqlmiuser account. Then, you’ll back up the database, gather connection information, and create an online data migration project. Finally, you’ll perform the migration cutover and verify the database and transaction log migration. These steps ensure a smooth transition to Azure’s cloud services.

## Lab Objectives

Lab Objectives

In this Exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create an SMB network share on the VM
- Task 2: Change MSSQLSERVER service to run under sqlmiuser account
- Task 3: Create a backup of the WideWorldImporters database
- Task 4: Retrieve SQL MI and SQL Server 2008 VM connection information
- Task 5: Create and run an online data migration project
- Task 6: Perform migration cutover
- Task 7: Verify database and transaction log migration

## Exercise 2: Perform database assessments
## Task 1: Create an SMB network share on the **<inject key="SQLVM Name" enableCopy="false"/>** VM

In this task, you create a new SMB network share on the <inject key="SQLVM Name" enableCopy="false"/> VM. DMS uses this shared folder for retrieving backups of the `WideWorldImporters` database during the database migration process.

1. On the **<inject key="SQLVM Name" enableCopy="false"/>** VM, open **Windows Explorer** by selecting its icon on the Windows Taskbar.

   ![The Windows Explorer icon is highlighted in the Windows Taskbar.]( images/windows-task-bar.png "Windows Taskbar")

2. In the Windows Explorer window, expand **Computer** in the tree view, select **Windows (C:)**, and then select **New folder** in the top menu.

   ![In Windows Explorer, Windows (C:) is selected under Computer in the left-hand tree view, and New folder is highlighted in the top menu.]( images/windows-explorer-new-folder.png "Windows Explorer")

3. Name the new folder **dms-backups**, then right-click the folder and select **Share with** and **Specific people...** in the context menu.

   ![In Windows Explorer, the context menu for the dms-backups folder is displayed, with Share with and Specific people highlighted.]( images/windows-explorer-folder-share-with.png "Windows Explorer")

4. In the File Sharing dialog, ensure the **sqlmiuser** is listed with a **Read/Write** permission level, and then select **Share**.

   ![In the File Sharing dialog, the sqlmiuser is highlighted and assigned a permission level of Read/Write.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/MCW-Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure/master/Hands-on%20lab/ images/file-sharing.png)

5. In the **Network discovery and file sharing** dialog, select the default value of **No, make the network that I am connected to a private network**.

   ![In the Network discovery and file sharing dialog, No, make the network that I am connected to a private network is highlighted.]( images/network-discovery-and-file-sharing.png "Network discovery and file sharing")

6. Back on the File Sharing dialog, note the shared folder's path, ```\\SQL2008-SUFFIX\dms-backups```, and select **Done** to complete the sharing process.

   ![The Done button is highlighted on the File Sharing dialog.]( images/EX2-Task1-S6.png "File Sharing")

## Task 2: Change MSSQLSERVER service to run under sqlmiuser account

In this task, you use the SQL Server Configuration Manager to update the service account used by the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service to the `sqlmiuser` account. Changing the account used for this service ensures it has the appropriate permissions to write backups to the shared folder.

1. On your **<inject key="SQLVM Name" enableCopy="false"/>** VM, select the **Start menu**, enter "SQL configuration" into the search bar, and then select **SQL Server Configuration Manager** from the search results.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "sql configuration" is entered into the search box, and SQL Server Configuration Manager is highlighted in the search results.]( images/windows-start-sql-configuration-manager.png "Windows search")

   > **Note**: Be sure to choose **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, and not **SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager**, which does not work for the installed SQL Server 2008 R2 database.

2. In the SQL Server Configuration Managed dialog, select **SQL Server Services** from the tree view on the left, then right-click **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** in the list of services and select **Properties** from the context menu.

   ![SQL Server Services is selected and highlighted in the tree view of the SQL Server Configuration Manager. In the Services pane, SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) is selected and highlighted. Properties is highlighted in the context menu.]( images/sql-server-configuration-manager-services.png "SQL Server Configuration Manager")

3. In the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog, select **This account** under Log on as, and enter the following:

   - **Account name**: `sqlmiuser`
   - **Password**: `Password.1234567890`

      ![In the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog, This account is selected under Log on as, and the sqlmiuser account name and password are entered.]( images/sql-server-service-properties.png "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties")

4. Select **OK**.

5. Select **Yes** in the Confirm Account Change dialog.

   ![The Yes button is highlighted in the Confirm Account Change dialog.]( images/confirm-account-change.png "Confirm Account Change")

6. Observe that the **Log On As** value for the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service changed to `./sqlmiuser`.

   ![In the list of SQL Server Services, the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service is highlighted.]( images/sql-server-service.png "SQL Server Services")

7. Close the SQL Server Configuration Manager.

## Task 3: Create a backup of the WideWorldImporters database

To perform online data migrations, DMS looks for database and transaction log backups in the shared SMB backup folder on the source database server. In this task, you create a backup of the `WideWorldImporters` database using SSMS and write it to the ```\\SQL2008-SUFFIX\dms-backups``` SMB network share you made in a previous task. The backup file needs to include a checksum, so you add that during the backup steps.

1. On the **<inject key="SQLVM Name" enableCopy="false"/>** VM, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** by entering "sql server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu.

   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.]( images/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

2. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter <inject key="SQLVM Name" /> into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

   ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQL2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure/fix/Hands-on%20lab/ images/ssms.png "Connect to Server")

   ```SQL
   USE WideWorldImporters;
   GO

   INSERT [dbo].[Game] (Title, Description, Rating, IsOnlineMultiplayer)
   VALUES ('Space Adventure', 'Explore the universe with our newest online multiplayer gaming experience. Build custom rocket ships and take off for the stars in an infinite open-world adventure.', 'T', 1)
   ```

1. To run the script, select **Run** from the Azure Data Studio toolbar.

    ![]( images/Ex1-Task1-S14.png "SSMS Toolbar")

1. After adding the new record to the `Games` table, back up the transaction logs. DMS detects any new backups and ships them to the migration service. Select **New Query** again in the toolbar, and paste the following script into the new query window:

   ```SQL
   USE master;
   GO

   BACKUP LOG WideWorldImporters
   TO DISK = 'c:\dms-backups\WideWorldImportersLog.trn'
   WITH CHECKSUM
   GO
   ```

1. To run the script, select **Run** from the Azure Data Studio toolbar.
